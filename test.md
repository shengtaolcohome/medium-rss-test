A startup thinks they’ve found the perfect solution.

Most young people don’t dare to dream of owning a home in the Bay.

San Francisco Bay, the land of opportunity and home to the birth of tens of thousands of successful companies, has an impending housing crisis. Today, about 8M people call the Bay Area their home, and this number is growing faster than the land can handle. The obvious corollary of this is surging housing prices. The median national rent is around $1500/mo. In San Francisco, it would be hard to find someone’s laundry room to live in for that same amount.

Surveys show that the average rent in San Francisco is nearly $3,800/mo. The new apartments that are popping up are asking five-figure rents. To cope with this, the new concept of ‘converted bedroom’ is rising. To me, this translated to sleeping in people’s kitchen and living rooms with a curtain separation and shelling out $2,000/mo.

A Bay area startup says they have a solution for this urban economy. What if I said it was possible to get back the rents you’ve paid for when you decided to move out. **CoHomeNow** allows you to buy equity in a home, something they call ‘fractional ownership’. Their sophisticated software exploits the sharing economy along with the matchmaking culture. A home will have several ‘matches’ (people interested in fractional ownership). Once you select a home you are shown potential co-buyers and you can message them. Once you both declare ‘it’s a match’ then you will be routed to the CoHomeNow team that will guide you through the next steps. If you decide to move out, you put your fractional unit up for sale on their platform. This they say will be a great fit for many people who want a low-risk investment and want a place to call their home. Looking from the ‘rent’ perspective, you’d potentially be getting back your ‘mortgage’ upon the re-sale of your fractional unit.

The rise of sharing economy, with ridesharing (Uber, Lyft), car-sharing (GetAround, Turo…) and a plethora of dating and matching apps that many of us have been exposed to, makes us very well versed with this concept. Apart from that, we all probably have roomed with someone at some point in our lives. CoHomeNow’s platform is pretty straightforward and seems like a logical transition in the real estate industry which has not seen many revolutionary changes in home buying/sales.

The ‘Match’ culture that was heavily popularized by apps like Tinder have opened doors to many revolutionary ideas. If you are able to find a partner, a room-mate, a friend, a mentor or a loved one all through tech-powered matching tools, why can’t you find your next buddy to buy a home with? From the looks of it, this would reduce your risk of taking on a huge investment, allows you to start investing earlier in life and gives you the flexibility to sell your ‘equity’ in the home. There is an algorithm in place that will make you eligible to be a potential match. This would be based on your income, debts, monthly commitment for ‘Co-home owning’, credit score and such.

Many startups rose to stardom, many have failed, many have changed lives, and some revolutionized the way people think. Yet this beautiful ‘sanctuary city’ thrives and continues to grow generation after generation. Perhaps the SF Bay is a loving mother that nurtures its children and everyone that comes under her arms. She is resilient; through the earthquakes and fires, and glimmers like the north star in the expanse of the sky, giving hope to all those who dream of a better life.
